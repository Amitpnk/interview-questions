```

20. ### What is the difference between UNION and UNION ALL?

UNION: To select related information from two tables UNION command is used. It is similar to JOIN command.

UNION All: The UNION ALL command is equal to the UNION command, except that UNION ALL selects all values. It will **not remove duplicate rows**, instead it will retrieve all rows from all tables.

------------------------------

21. ### How can we get count of the number of records in a table?

Following are the queries can be used to get the count of records in a table -


Select * from <tablename>

28. What is the use of SET NOCOUNT ON/OFF statement?

By default, NOCOUNT is set to OFF and it returns number of records got affected whenever the command is getting executed. If the user doesn't want to display the number of records affected, it can be explicitly set to ON- (SET NOCOUNT ON).

29. Which SQL server table is used to hold the stored procedure scripts?

Sys.SQL_Modules is a SQL Server table used to store the script of stored procedure.

Name of the stored procedure is saved in the table called Sys.Procedures.

30. What are Magic Tables in SQL Server?

During DML operations like Insert, Delete, and Update, SQL Server creates magic tables to hold the values during the DML operations. These magic tables are used inside the triggers for data transaction.

31. What is the difference between SUBSTR and CHARINDEX in the SQL Server?

The SUBSTR function is used to return specific portion of string in a given string. But, CHARINDEX function gives character position in a given specified string.

SUBSTRING('Smiley',1,3)
Gives result as Smi

CHARINDEX('i', 'Smiley',1)
Gives 3 as result as I appears in 3rd position of the string
