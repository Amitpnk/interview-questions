2. ### Difference between Webform, MVC 5 and .NET Core?

|| Webform | MVC5 | .NET Core |
|---|---|---|---|
|Cross platofrm|No|No|Yes|

Step 3: 
In configure method from startup.cs

```c#
app.UseMiddleware<CustomMiddleware>();
```

12. ### Differernce between ConfigureServices & Configure method in Startup.cs

ConfigureServices - helps to configure dependency object

Configure - helps us to configure middleware

13. ### Difference between Scoped vs Transient vs Singleton?

* *AddScoped* - With scoped service, we get same instance within scope of given http request but new instancce accross diferent http requests

* *AddTransient* -  With transient service,  <u>a new instance is provided every time an instance is requested</u> whether it is scope of same http request or across different http requests

* *AddSingleton* - When service is first requested and that single instance is used by all http requests throughout application.

|| In scope of given http request  | Across different http requests | 
|---|---|---|
|Scoped|Same instance|New instance|
|Transient|New instance|New instance|
|Singleton|Same instance|Same instance|
